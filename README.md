# Learning Python 

![Level: 1](https://img.shields.io/badge/level-1-blue.svg)

This repository was created as a final project for our algorithm class.

## Premises

- All python code was manually written, without help of any kind of AI, for study purposes.

> As we have experience with Docker, Shell and some other stuff we added some helpful scripts to get started with.

## Usage

You must run this in a Unix-like shell (such as Linux, macOS, or WSL).
